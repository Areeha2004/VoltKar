You are working on the Volt (EnergizeWeb) codebase.

Goal:
Audit, correct, and expose accurate Previous Month (Full Month) usage and cost.
This data is a hard dependency for forecasting, budgeting, and dashboard stability.

Context:
Forecasting logic relies on previous month data as the baseline.
If previous month usage or cost is incorrect or missing, early-month forecasts become unreliable.

Tasks:

1. Data Fetch Verification
   - Review how previous month readings are fetched in `computeStatsBundle`.
   - Ensure readings are filtered using correct month/year boundaries.
   - Do NOT assume 31 days. Use actual calendar dates.

2. Correct Usage Aggregation (Critical)
   - Previous month usage must be calculated as:
     lastReading.value - firstReading.value
   - Do NOT sum readings.
   - If fewer than 2 readings exist:
     • Flag a data quality warning
     • Do NOT fabricate usage

3. Cost Calculation
   - Use TariffEngine exclusively to compute previous month cost
   - Ensure slab-based non-linear pricing is applied correctly

4. Validation & Guardrails
   - If previous month usage ≤ 0:
     • Mark data as invalid
     • Add a warning in `data_quality.warnings`
   - Ensure no NaN or null values propagate into StatsBundle

5. StatsBundle Exposure
   - Ensure these fields are always populated when data exists:
     statsBundle.prevMonthFull.usage_kwh
     statsBundle.prevMonthFull.cost_pkr
   - These values must be consistent with meter readings and tariff logic

6. Minimal Display for Verification
   - Add a small, non-intrusive display on the Dashboard:
     “Last Month: {usage_kwh} kWh · Rs {cost_pkr}”
   - This is for correctness verification, not analytics

7. Logging (Development Only)
   - Add a clear console log:
     [StatsService] PrevMonth Usage: X kWh, Cost: Rs Y
   - This helps validate correctness during development

Constraints:
- Do NOT change database schema
- Do NOT add mock data
- Do NOT modify forecasting logic yet
- Reuse existing aggregation and tariff utilities where possible

Success Criteria:
- Previous month usage and cost are correct, stable, and visible
- Forecasting can safely rely on this data
- Dashboard no longer shows zeros or blank values for previous month
